# DISABLED: Rule to update the central research_index.json
# 
# This rule has been disabled due to persistent execution failures.
# Instead, a dedicated script in the scripts/ directory is now used to update the index.
# 
# After saving a report, Cline will instruct the user to run:
# scripts/update_research_index.py
# 
# This manual step replaces the previously unreliable automated rule.
