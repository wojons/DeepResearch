# Notice Regarding Content Generation and Copyright

## LLM Generation

Much of the content within the individual research task folders (specifically `report.md` and potentially snippets in `knowledge/`) in this repository is generated with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on prompts and guidance provided by the repository owner. While efforts are made to ensure accuracy and proper citation, the nature of LLM generation means errors or misinterpretations may occur.

## Use and Licensing

The code components of this repository (e.g., any HTML viewer code) and the overall structure are licensed under the MIT License (see `LICENSE` file). You are free to use, modify, and distribute the structure and code as per the license terms.

## Copyright of Research Content

The *research content* itself (summaries, analyses within `report.md`, source metadata in `sources/`) is provided for informational purposes. The raw source materials potentially stored in `knowledge/` folders (and ignored by `.gitignore`) likely retain their original copyrights.

If you believe any generated content within the `report.md` files infringes on existing copyright, please open an issue in this GitHub repository detailing the specific content and the basis for the copyright claim. We will investigate and address valid concerns promptly.

## Disclaimer

The research reports and summaries are generated with AI assistance and should not be considered definitive or a substitute for professional advice or direct consultation of primary sources. Use the information responsibly.
