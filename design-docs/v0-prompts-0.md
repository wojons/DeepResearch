**3. Prompt for Generating HTML Viewer Structure**

*(Generated based on user request to build the viewer interface)*

```markdown
# Role: Front-End Web Developer

Act as a front-end web developer. Your task is to create the basic file structure and initial code for an HTML-based viewer to display research projects managed within this workspace (`DeepResearch/`).

# Task Requirements

Create a simple web interface with the following components and functionality:

1.  **File Structure:**
    * Create a new directory named `viewer` in the project root (`DeepResearch/`).
    * Inside `viewer/`, create the following files using the `write_to_file` tool:
        * `index.html`: The main HTML page.
        * `style.css`: For basic styling.
        * `script.js`: For JavaScript logic.

2.  **HTML (`viewer/index.html`):**
    * Set up a basic HTML5 document structure.
    * Include a link to `style.css` and `script.js`.
    * Create a two-column layout (e.g., using divs or a simple framework).
        * **Left Pane:** An empty container (e.g., `<div id="project-list"></div>`) where the list of research projects will be dynamically loaded. Include a placeholder title like "Research Projects".
        * **Right Pane:** An empty container (e.g., `<pre id="report-content"></pre>` or `<div id="report-content"></div>`) where the selected `report.md` content will be displayed. Include a placeholder title like "Report Content".

3.  **CSS (`viewer/style.css`):**
    * Add some basic styling to define the two-column layout (e.g., using flexbox or grid).
    * Add minimal styling for the project list items (e.g., padding, cursor pointer) and the content display area (e.g., font-family monospace for `<pre>`, basic padding).

4.  **JavaScript (`viewer/script.js`):**
    * **On page load:**
        * Fetch the content of the `research_index.json` file (located at the project root).
        * Parse the JSON data (which is an array of project objects).
        * Dynamically populate the `#project-list` div in `index.html`. For each project object in the JSON array, create a clickable element (e.g., a `<div>` or `<a>`) displaying the project's title and date. Store the project's relative path (e.g., `./AI_YouTube_Script_Techniques/`) as a data attribute on the clickable element.
    * **On project click:**
        * Add an event listener to the `#project-list` container (using event delegation).
        * When a project element is clicked, retrieve its stored relative path.
        * Construct the full path to the corresponding `report.md` file (e.g., `${relativePath}report.md`).
        * Fetch the content of that `report.md` file.
        * Display the fetched **raw Markdown text** inside the `#report-content` container (e.g., setting the `textContent` of a `<pre>` tag). *(We will handle Markdown rendering in a later step)*.

# Instructions for Cline

1.  Confirm the plan to create the `viewer/` directory and the three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).
2.  Use the `write_to_file` tool to create each file with the basic content described above. Provide the complete code for each file.

Let's start with this basic structure. We can add features like Markdown rendering, search, sorting, and download/share buttons later.
```

**4. Prompt for Moving HTML Viewer Files**

*(Generated based on user request to move files for GitHub Pages)*

```markdown
# Role: File Management Assistant

Act as a file management assistant for this workspace.

# Task: Move HTML Viewer Files

Please move the following files from the `./viewer/` directory to the project root directory (`./`):
* `index.html`
* `style.css`
* `script.js`

# Instructions for Cline:

1.  Identify the correct operating system command for moving files (e.g., `mv` for Linux/macOS, `move` for Windows). Prefer `mv` if unsure.
2.  Construct the command(s) needed to perform the move (e.g., `mv viewer/index.html .`, `mv viewer/style.css .`, `mv viewer/script.js .`).
3.  **Crucially, present the exact command(s) you plan to execute to me (the user) for confirmation first.**
4.  **Do not execute any commands without my explicit approval.**
5.  Once approved, use the `execute_command` tool to run the command(s).
```
