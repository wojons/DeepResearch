    * 4.3. `update_research_index.md` Lifecycle:
        * Initial interactive rule created.
        * Changed to fully automated (attempted inference) -> Failed consistently.
        * Reverted to interactive -> Failed consistently.
        * Rule currently disabled (file emptied/deleted).
    * 4.4. Token Usage Concerns Raised by User.
5.  **Phase 5: HTML Viewer Development**
    * 5.1. User Request: Build viewer site structure.
    * 5.2. PAA Prompt Generation: Instructing Cline as a web developer (HTML, CSS, JS).
    * 5.3. Initial Viewer Structure Created by Cline (in `viewer/` subdirectory).
    * 5.4. User Feedback: Viewer should be in project root for GitHub Pages.
    * 5.5. PAA Prompt Generation: Instructing Cline to move viewer files (using `execute_command`).
6.  **Phase 6: Memory Bank Integration**
    * 6.1. User Request: Leverage Memory Bank for context management/token usage.
    * 6.2. User Preference: Full automation desired.
    * 6.3. PAA Proposal: Create `.clinerules/memory_management.md`.
    * 6.4. Rule Implementation:
        * Attempted automated saving of final report summary (using `suggest_tool_code` with embedded logic and reliability caveats).
        * Added automated memory query instruction to `research_process.md`.
7.  **Phase 7: Documentation & Current Status**
    * 7.1. User Request: Amazon PR/FAQ design document -> Generated by PAA.
    * 7.2. User Request: Statedump (This document) -> Generated by PAA.
    * 7.3. **Current State:**
        * Rules updated to mandate deep research per section (~5-7 sources/subsection) and professional prose writing style (`research_process.md`).
        * Rules attempt automated Memory Bank query/saving (`research_process.md`, `memory_management.md`).
        * JSON index update rule is disabled (`update_research_index.md` empty/deleted).
        * Task `index.html` generation rule is deleted.
        * HTML viewer files exist, likely moved to project root.
        * User is ready to run the demanding `v3` YouTube script prompt (with outline, keywords per section, min 1000 words/section) using the latest rules.
    * 7.4. **Known Issues/Next Steps:** Verify if the latest rules/prompt produce sufficient depth/quality; monitor token usage; address text merging/sequential writing if needed; potentially revisit JSON index update or Memory Bank reliability.

**Narrative Summary:**

Our collaboration began with the goal of creating effective prompts for Cline, evolving into designing a comprehensive "DeepResearch" workflow. You provided initial context including Cline documentation and Fabric patterns. We first established the PAA (Prompt Architect Assistant) persona for me to act as an educational collaborator.

We then defined the core structure: using `.clinerules` for custom instructions, establishing a standard folder structure (`prompts/`, `sources/`, `knowledge/`, `report.md`) for each research task, and setting up essential project files like `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and `NOTICE.md`. An initial idea for generating task-specific `index.html` files and updating a central `research_index.json` was formulated, leading to the creation of corresponding rules (`html_generation_rule.md`, `update_research_index.md`).

The primary test case became generating a detailed report on "AI Techniques for Engaging YouTube Scripts." The initial attempts yielded results lacking sufficient detail and quality. This led us to refine the PAA role (CDR-PAA) and implement strategies learned from a meta-research task you initiated on "Prompting for Long-Form Content." Key strategies included providing detailed outlines directly within the prompt (`v2` and `v3` prompts) and iteratively refining the `research_process.md` rule file.

Rule refinement addressed several issues: explicitly demanding greater detail, enforcing a professional writing style (prose over bullet points), increasing source requirements (first overall, then shifting to a demanding per-section approach), and attempting to clarify Cline's role as a deep researcher.

We encountered significant challenges with rule automation and clarity. The `html_generation_rule.md` produced confusing output and was eventually removed as the task-specific HTML became redundant. The `update_research_index.md` rule proved unreliable in both automated and interactive forms, leading to its current disabled state. You also raised concerns about high token usage during complex research tasks.

Separately, we addressed the need for a web-based viewer for the research reports. I provided prompts for Cline to act as a web developer, generating the basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structure (initially in a `viewer/` folder, then moving it to the project root per your request for GitHub Pages compatibility).

Most recently, we shifted focus to Cline's Memory Bank feature to potentially improve context management. Rejecting an interactive approach, you requested full automation. We created `.clinerules/memory_management.md` with a rule attempting automated saving of report summaries and modified `research_process.md` to include an automated memory query at the start, acknowledging the reliability risks of this automation.

Finally, we generated documentation (PR/FAQ, this Statedump) to capture the project's design and journey.

**Current Status:** The project is configured with the latest, highly demanding rules in `research_process.md` (per-section deep research, professional prose), automated memory bank interactions via `memory_management.md`, and disabled JSON updates. You are poised to test the `v3` YouTube script prompt under these conditions. The primary goal remains achieving high-quality, detailed report generation, with ongoing challenges related to LLM capability, automation reliability, and token management.
