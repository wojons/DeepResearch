# Progress: DeepResearch Workflow Automation for Cline

**What works:**

- The core concept of using `.clinerules` to define a research workflow is established.
- A standardized folder structure (`{TASK_NAME}/{prompts, sources, knowledge, report.md}`) can be created.
- Prompts can be structured with outlines and keywords to guide research.
- The process for gathering and converting source content to Markdown (`knowledge/`) is defined.
- The process for documenting sources (`sources/citations.md`) is defined.
- The process for generating the final report (`report.md`) based on analysis is defined.
- A basic HTML viewer structure has been created and moved to the project root.
- Automated Memory Bank querying at the start of a task is included in the `research_process.md` rule.
- An attempt at automated saving of the report summary to Memory Bank is included in `memory_management.md`.
- **Relevant Fabric patterns have been reviewed, selected, and organized into `.prompts/patterns/` to enhance research capabilities.**

**What's left to build:**

- Potential refinements to the automated Memory Bank saving process for greater reliability.
- Further enhancements to the HTML viewer (e.g., Markdown rendering, search, sorting).
- A robust and reliable method for handling potentially large report outputs if they exceed context limits (e.g., sequential writing and merging).
- **Creation of the automation rule for pattern management.**
- **Updating the design documentation with the pattern review summary.**

**Current status:**

The project is configured with the latest, highly demanding rules in `research_process.md` (mandating per-section deep research and specific professional writing styles). Automated Memory Bank interactions are defined, but their reliability is noted as a known issue. The problematic JSON index update rule has been replaced with a dedicated Python script (`scripts/update_research_index.py`). The HTML viewer files are in the project root. Project files have been reorganized for better structure, with scripts in the `scripts/` directory, index files in the `index/` directory, and test files in the `test/` directory. The `/reports/` directory has been added to `.gitignore` to prevent research outputs from being committed to the main repository. Relevant Fabric patterns have been integrated. The next step is to test the core research workflow with a demanding prompt under these latest rules and leveraging the newly integrated patterns.

**Known issues:**

- **LLM Capability:** Final report depth and quality are still heavily dependent on the underlying LLM's analysis and synthesis capabilities, even with strong rule guidance.
- **Automation Reliability:** The automated Memory Bank saving may still be unreliable and may fail or produce suboptimal results.
- **Token Usage:** The requirement for deep research across many sources per section significantly increases token consumption and processing time, potentially hitting context limits.
- **HTML Viewer:** The viewer is a separate component requiring ongoing development/maintenance.
- **Manual Step Required:** The `research_index.json` update now requires a manual step (running the `scripts/update_research_index.py` script) after report generation, rather than being fully automated.

**Evolution of project decisions:**

- Initial focus on basic prompt generation evolved into designing a comprehensive workflow.
- The importance of `.clinerules` for guiding complex behavior became evident through iterative refinement.
- Challenges with automation led to replacing unreliable rules with manual script execution for certain tasks.
- The need for a structured approach to managing and leveraging external patterns was identified, leading to the pattern review and integration step.
